Download Google Photos with puppeteer

## Open new window

This works from the console!

I think we need both a size, and a unique name

```js
window.open(
  "https://photos.google.com/",
  "Worker1",
  "width=640,height=400"
)
window.open(
  "https://photos.google.com/",
  "Worker2",
  "width=640,height=400"
)

```
